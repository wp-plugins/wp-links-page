You may edit the link or description with the edit button.

To reorder your links simply drag and drop them into place, then click ‘Save’ at the bottom of the screen.

When updating the links, press the edit button and make your changes. Click update to save your changes. Please do not try to update multiple links at the same time. The update button will only update its link, not any others.

Clicking the ‘Update Screenshots’ button on the this page can take several minutes depending on your connection. Please be patient while it retrieves new images. If for some reason it does not automatically refresh when completed, simply refresh the page to see the new images.

= Settings =

Visit the Settings subpage in the WP Links Page section to set the timeframe to retrieve new screenshots and edit the settings for the links page view.

Options:

* Screenshot refresh rate: Twice Daily, Daily, Every two days, Weekly, Every two Weeks, Monthly.
* Display: Grid or List.
* Columns for Grid: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5

= Widget =

A new widget is also provided. This widget will display a one column grid of the links with descriptions only showing if the ‘List’ option is chosen.

If using a enhanced Text Widget you may enter the the Wp links Page shortcode to display links.

= Shortcode =

Use this shortcode to add your links to any page or post:

    [wp_links_page_free]

This displays all links with the global settings.
